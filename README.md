# Shuffler
This simple portable application is designed for shuffling files by adding random numbers to the beginning of the name of a file (e.g. "Hello.wav" > "12Hello.wav").
It may be useful if you need to use your old-fasioned car radio with usb-drive containing music files and you'd like to play that files in [pseudo]random order.
CAUTION: that app will rename files in ITS PARENT folder
